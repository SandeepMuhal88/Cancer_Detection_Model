This project is an open-source implementation of a machine learning model for **cancer detection**. It demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training can be used to identify cancerous cases from medical datasets with high accuracy.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Cancer detection is a crucial step in early diagnosis and treatment. This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various medical attributes.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is:

- **[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))**
- Features: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- Labels: `0` for benign, `1` for malignant

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔬 Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
- 🧹 Feature Selection
- 🧠 Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- 📊 Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall)
- 🧾 Cancer Prediction based on new input data

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-detection-ml.git
cd cancer-detection-ml
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook or script:

```bash
jupyter notebook Cancer_Detection.ipynb
```

## 📈 Results

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting cancer based on the training dataset. You can also try predicting on custom input using the model.

| Model             | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 96%     |
| Random Forest       | 98%     |
| SVM                 | 97%     |
