## 🔍 Project Overview

We make a cancer detect project using machine learning And Deep Learning.
So first step is that we make a machine learning model and then we make a deep learning model.
1-10 Model make. and combine them

So we are in leraning stage build that model and make it better.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is:

- **[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))**
- Features: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- Labels: `0` for benign, `1` for malignant

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔬 Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
- 🧹 Feature Selection
- 🧠 Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- 📊 Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall)
- 🧾 Cancer Prediction based on new input data

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-detection-ml.git
cd cancer-detection-ml
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook or script:

```bash
jupyter notebook Cancer_Detection.ipynb
```
